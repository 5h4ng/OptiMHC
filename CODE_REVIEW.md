# Code Review: optiMHC Package

# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
- Introduced a `Config` class in `core/config.py` to encapsulate configuration management. This class supports loading from YAML or dict, provides attribute access, and is extensible for future needs.
- Refactored the `Pipeline` and CLI to use the new `Config` class, allowing seamless integration between CLI, YAML configuration, and the pipeline logic.
- Motivation: This change follows modern software design patterns, improves maintainability, and makes the configuration system more flexible and robust for future extensions (e.g., programmatic configuration, validation, plugin support).

## Overview

**optiMHC** is a high-performance rescoring pipeline for immunopeptidomics data, aiming to enhance peptide identification by integrating multiple feature generators and machine learning-based rescoring. The package is modular, supports extensible feature generation, and provides both command-line and programmatic interfaces.

## Strengths

### 1. **Modular and Extensible Design**
- The codebase is organized into clear modules: core pipeline, feature generators, rescoring, parsing, and visualization.
- Feature generators are implemented as separate classes, making it easy to add new types.
- The pipeline supports experiment mode for systematic benchmarking of feature/model combinations.

### 2. **Comprehensive Feature Support**
- Integrates a wide range of feature generators (Basic, SpectraSimilarity, DeepLC, OverlappingPeptide, PWM, MHCflurry, NetMHCpan, NetMHCIIpan).
- YAML-based configuration allows flexible pipeline customization.

### 3. **Good Use of Modern Python Ecosystem**
- Leverages popular libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, mokapot, matplotlib, seaborn, tqdm, etc.).
- Uses type hints and docstrings for better code clarity.

### 4. **Usability and Documentation**
- Well-documented README with usage instructions, configuration options, and examples.
- Command-line interface is straightforward and scriptable.

## Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Code Quality and Maintainability**
- Some files (e.g., `psm_container.py`, feature generators) are very large and could be split for readability.
- There is some code duplication (e.g., memory logging, feature generator instantiation logic).
- Some TODOs are present (e.g., refactoring CLI with `click`, dynamic import of feature generators, memory bottleneck handling).
- Error handling is basic in some places (e.g., input parsing, feature generation failures).

### 2. **Extensibility and Flexibility**
- Feature generator registration is static; dynamic plugin loading would improve extensibility.
- The pipeline is tightly coupled to the YAML config structure; consider supporting programmatic configuration for advanced users.

### 3. **Testing and Validation**
- No mention of automated tests or CI in the README or codebase. Test coverage is unclear.
- Edge cases (e.g., missing/invalid config fields, failed external tool calls) may not be fully handled.

### 4. **Performance and Scalability**
- Memory usage is a known bottleneck (see TODOs in feature generation). Large datasets may cause issues.
- Multiprocessing is used, but distributed or out-of-core processing is not supported.

### 5. **Documentation**
- While the README is strong, in-code documentation could be improved (e.g., more detailed docstrings, usage examples for each module).
- No API documentation or developer guide for extending the package.

## Recommendations & Next Steps

1. **Refactor Large Modules**
   - Split large files (e.g., `psm_container.py`, feature generators) into smaller, focused modules.
   - Remove code duplication (e.g., memory logging, feature generator instantiation).

2. **Improve CLI and User Experience**
   - Refactor CLI using `click` for better usability and extensibility.
   - Add more helpful error messages and input validation.

3. **Enhance Extensibility**
   - Implement dynamic plugin/feature generator registration (e.g., via entry points or a plugin registry).
   - Allow programmatic pipeline configuration in addition to YAML.

4. **Testing and CI**
   - Add unit and integration tests for all major modules.
   - Set up continuous integration (e.g., GitHub Actions) to ensure code quality and test coverage.

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile and optimize memory usage in feature generation.
   - Consider supporting chunked or out-of-core processing for large datasets.

6. **Documentation**
   - Expand in-code docstrings and add developer documentation for extending the pipeline.
   - Consider generating API docs (e.g., with Sphinx).

7. **User Support and Examples**
   - Add more example datasets and configuration files.
   - Provide troubleshooting tips and FAQ in the documentation.

## Conclusion

optiMHC is a promising and well-structured package for immunopeptidomics rescoring, with a strong foundation and clear modularity. Addressing the above areas will further improve its maintainability, usability, and impact in the proteomics community.
